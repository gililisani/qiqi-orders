## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

1. **Database Migrations**: Run the SQL files in order:
   ```sql
   -- Run these in your Supabase SQL editor
   \i create_order_history_table.sql
   \i add_tracking_to_orders.sql
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure these are set:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` - For notification callbacks
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - For server-side operations

3. **Email Service**: Configure your preferred email service in the notifications API

The order process is now complete with comprehensive tracking, notifications, and admin controls while maintaining the secure, clean architecture you prefer [[memory:8781152]].
